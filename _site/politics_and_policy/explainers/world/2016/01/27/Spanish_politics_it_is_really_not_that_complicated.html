<div class="post_body">
<p>So remember when <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/21/its-in-various-spanish-party-leaders-interest-to-pretend-that-spanish-politics-are-in-disarray-even-though-the-path-forward-psoe-podemos-regional-parties-is-so-obvious/">I said</a> I was going to keep bragging about how I was right about Spanish politics? I haven’t changed my mind about that.</p>

<p>And I also haven’t changed my mind about what’s going to happen: the Prime Minister is clearly going to come from the Socialist Party (PSOE), and this is going to happen because PSOE will get parliamentary support from the new “far”- left party Podemos.</p>

<p>This week saw my “theory” (which is basically just math, carried to its only logical conclusion) get a boost when the leader of Podemos shocked everyone (besides me!) by proposing that Podemos support PSOE in forming a governing coalition.</p>

<p>**But Spanish elite opinion continues to be intentionally thick-headed about how unusual this would be. **</p>

<p>As an example <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/21/opinion/1453404179_980796.html">El Pais’ ridiculous editorial</a> ”Rajoy can’t, Sanchez shouldn’t” frets that Sanchez shouldn’t make this pact with the devils.</p>

<p>First, though, a quick explanation of the title. Rajoy is Spain’s current (but soon to be former…) Prime Minister. He’s the leader of the rightwing People’s Party, which won the most seats in Spain’s Parliament (123 out of 350) but <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/spains-not-in-crisis/">has no path to actually forming a majority</a>. Sanchez is the leader of PSOE which won “only” 90 seats. The crux of El Pais’ argument is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sánchez can’t govern alone with only 90 deputies —the worst result in the Socialist Party’s history — and much less so if, to govern, he needs the help (explicit or implicit) of those whose objectives are to separate Catalunya from Spain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first point is super silly. Yeah 90 deputies isn’t a lot. But come on – who are Podemos’ voters? Mostly ex-PSOE voters disenchanted that the party wasn’t clearly enough against austerity. A coalition that <strong>forced</strong> PSOE to take an anti-austerity line would be a win for them. Together PSOE+Podemos has 155-159 seats. That’s not a majority, but there have been <strong>many</strong> times when Spanish parties formed governments by coalitioning with other (mostly regional) parties. The Socialists did it in 1989, 1993, 2004, and 2008. And PP did it in 1996 and 2000. So actually, these coalitions are the norm not the exception in Spain.</p>

<p>The second point is a bigger deal. Regional parties that want more autonomy (and/or independence) have always played an important role in Spain in providing those key extra seats that allow ”minority governments” to get a majority of Parliaments’ deputies to allow them to govern. They always want concessions in return. This time, those concessions truly threaten the idea of a unified Spain because the main concession they seek is the right for their regions to vote whether to remain part of Spain or break away.</p>

<p>El Pais doesn’t like that. I personally don’t know who’s side I really back in the unity / self-determination argument. But I don’t think it matters, because PSOE+Podemos clearly <strong>need</strong> these regional parties in their coalition. It’s not “if” they get in bed together but rather under what terms. Case in point: hilariously and outrageously, El Pais’ editorial bitches about the need for PSOE to rely on regional separatist parties but OFFERS NO ALTERNATIVE. At the end they flippantly float the idea of having PSOE form an “alliance” with PP to ”reform the Constitution”. I’m sorry, but… No. Spanish voters have spoken and – do the math – they want an anti-austerity coalition. It’s just not that complicated.</p>

<p>Amazingly, this idea – a grand coalition between PP, PSOE, and Citizens (a centrist party that won 40 seats but was expected to win more) – is <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/21/opinion/1453404179_980796.html">popular</a> in Spain. I’ll shave my head into a Spanish flag if it actually happens. PSOE+Podemos are in a fine position to form a government - a weak but doable 155ish seats that is in the ballpark of various Spanish governments’ leading-party seat totals. Most importantly, PSOE and Podemos basically want the same thing – to fight austerity. They’ve got the numbers and they’ve got the shared ideology, and that means that a solid coalition is only a matter of time.</p>
