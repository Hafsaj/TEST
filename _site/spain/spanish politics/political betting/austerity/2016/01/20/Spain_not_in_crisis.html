<p>Reading Spanish newspapers and talking to Spanish friends and Spanish customers at my cafe, the sense is of a country in political disarray and crisis. What’s actually happened is simple: anti-austerity politics has arrived in Spain.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom is that Spain was a two-party democracy, and now that there are multiple powerful parties, governing has become impossible.</p>

<p>It’s true that Spain’s prime ministers have only ever come from two parties – the left-wing Socialists (PSOE) and the right-wing Popular Party (PP.</p>

<p>And it is true that two newcomers have put a stake through this status quo. Citizens is an anti-corruption, pro-national-unity, vaguely right-wing party. Podemos is a left-wing outfit, a remarkably effective political offspring of protests a few years ago against Spain’s hardcore leach-like blood-letting budget-cutting.</p>

<p>In its <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/world/europe/spain-election-rajoy-citizens-podemos.html?_r=0">elections on 20 December</a>, PP won the most seats (123 out of 350). But to get a majority, it needs to form a coalition with PSOE (90 seats), whose leader has ruled out this idea. The clear alternative is for PSOE to coalition with Podemos (some 65-69 seats), which gets near the majority – but no cigar. Could PSOE form a coalition with Podemos <strong>and</strong> Citizens (40 seats)? The problem is that Citizens was founded on the altar of national unity, whereas Podemos has promised to advocate for regions to be able to vote on whether to break away from Spain as independent countries. Podemos and Citizens are dysfunctional bedfellows. This seeming logjam is the basis on which the sirens of conventional wisdom have cried crisis.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn5LXZv11ww">Dig a little deeper</a>, though, and you see that the idea that Spain has <strong>not</strong> been a two party system during its three and a half decades of democracy. Spain’s governments have often relied on coalitions between PSOE (or PP) and regional parties that extracted tax-relief and/or pro-regional-autonomy concessions.</p>

<p>That’s what will happen here, again. Right-wing PP may have won the most seats, but make no mistake – this election has actually been a <a href="http://Spanish Election Marks Another Rejection of Austerity - The ...">victory for the anti-austerity left wing</a> in Spain. Yes, PSOE+Podemos will need to bring on a few regional parties, just as PSOE (when Podemos did not yet exist) has done in the past. But talks of a crisis or a sea-change are way overblown.</p>
