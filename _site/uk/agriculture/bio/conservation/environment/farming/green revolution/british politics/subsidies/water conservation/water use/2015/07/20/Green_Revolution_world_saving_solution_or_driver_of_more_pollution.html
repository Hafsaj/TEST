<p>The 2.5 billion people inhabiting this planet in 1950 have just about tripled to over 7 billion today. Yet we haven’t had mass starvation. Many thank the Green Revolution for this catastrophe avoided. The Green Revolution was a series of steps taken in Mexico, India, and later much of Asia and Latin America, where varieties of wheat (and later rice and other crops) were developed that yielded much more wheat (or rice, or what-have-you) per acre of farmland. Critics allege that the Green Revolution has been a mixed blessing at best; all of these high-yield varieties also require much higher inputs of fertiliser, water, <a href="https://instagram.com/p/4_6PAfkbd9/">matcha green tea*</a>, herbicide, and pesticides, and the Green Revolution is closely tied to the general trend away from traditional mixed-crop agriculture towards modern high-input single-crop farming.</p>

<p>A couple articles (<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/a-green-revolution-this-time-for-africa/?_r=0" target="_blank">here </a> is one, and <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/energizing-the-green-revolution-in-africa/">here </a>is another) now pose the question of how to bring the Green Revolution to Africa. In principle, this could be great, or problematic; depends on the details. What I don’t understand is why Africa’s governments are being asked to subsidise this. Shouldn’t a movement that brings higher agricultural yields be self-sustaining? Rachel tries to answer my worries, but all I can spit back is more queries! </p>

<p>The Green Revolution won its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">creator</a> a peace prize;
But its legacy is a mixed bag of lows along with the highs:</p>

<p>*Its high-yield seeds brought food to billions.</p>

<p>*But enviros worry farms worldwide are now pesticide filled pavilions.</p>

<p>Rachel: 
If it’s a win-win situation: profits going up and hunger going down,
The idea of the <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/a-green-revolution-this-time-for-africa/" target="_blank">government subsidising it</a> makes you frown.
But when most of the farmers across the African continent are women,
How else are they supposed to start the process, then?</p>

<p>Andrew:
The green revolution makes farms higher-input, higher-output, which <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2015/04/22/eco-modernists-are-right-to-push-for-intensification-but-wrong-to-think-that-we-dont-also-need-carbon-taxes/" target="_blank">can be good</a>.
And should women be able to get loans? Of course they should.
But if the green revo’s profitable, why does it need extra subsidies?
Micro-finance should empower, not just give money for high-yield seeds.</p>

<p>Rachel:
Concerns over toxic fertiliser and poisonous pesticides are real.
But there has to be a middle ground (no pun intended), I feel.
Farms won’t thrive if they’re choked by chemicals, that’s no mistake.
But surely we can learn from the past and find a way to give African women a break?</p>

<p>Andrew:
The green revolution, as a movement, is just so funny.
Backers say we need to use subsidies to make it make money?
Yet it’s people who believe in the power of market forces who tend to love it;
I say, let good price signals dictate how intensively farmers farm, and tell these pesky governments to shove it!</p>

<p>Rachel:
Maybe you’re right - could we not have subsidies to start?
Then phase them out when farmers get their work down to a fine art?
Although it would be difficult to find a way to make that fair
And cutting famers off could be seen as a lack of care.</p>

<p>Andrew:
I hate these green revo subsidies, whether permanent or temporary.
Though food is delicious, from the dwarfest wheat plant to the reddest cherry,
Not everything that is <i>good</i> deserves a subsidy.
And food’s total external costs/benefits probably skews costs, with grave effects for climate and biodiversity.</p>

<p>Rachel:
You’re probably right - if the system’s good anyway
Then it shouldn’t be necessary for the government to pay.
But what other system feeds the poorest of the poor?
The Green Revolution isn’t perfect, but how can we do more?</p>

<p>Andrew:
If people are poor, the best thing is to give them money, no, dude?
Then <i>they</i> can decide how much food to buy, and farmers can decide how to grow that food.
In Uttar Pradesh, subsidies made farmers go for green revo like bees on honey.
Now there’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/opinion/the-ganges-water-crisis.html?_r=0" target="_blank">no more water in the ground</a>, and ain’t no one feeling like a clever bunny.</p>

<p>Rachel: 
Respecting agency and choice by giving money is ideal
But until that system is more accepted, people’s hunger remains real
What about a greener system similar to <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/andrew-asks-rachel-who-are-the-philadelphia-76ers-of-the-development-space/" target="_blank">our beloved Give Directly?</a>
This is probably another stepping stone towards my dream of <a href="http://www.wealthequality.org/" target="_blank">Wealth Equality. </a></p>

<p>Andrew:
My bottom line is the Green Revolution is a complicated beast.
It’s not a simple “this is good, let’s subsidise it, yay!” feast.
We must be <a href="http://rajpatel.org/2014/08/29/every-factoid-is-a-mystery-how-to-think-more-clearly-about-the-green-revolution-and-other-agricultural-claims/" target="_blank">curious</a> and skeptical, even if the supposed goal is avoiding starvation.
Remembering that these subsidies’ results are often big agri-business elation.</p>
