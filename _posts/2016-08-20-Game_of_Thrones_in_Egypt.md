 The story of the Arab Spring in Egypt is, in broad strokes, the story of how the Muslim Brotherhood won power through controversial elections only to lose that power a year later to a military takeover that re-installed most of the same establishment that had ruled through iron fists and crony capitalism during the decades-long dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak.

 What I hadn’t known until reading Scott Anderson's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/11/magazine/isis-middle-east-arab-spring-fractured-lands.html?_r=1">long-read account</a> of the Arab Spring (and subsequent extended winter) is just how Ned-Stark-tactically badly the Muslim Brotherhood misplayed its hand. Here are the key parts (emphasis mine):
>On the day he assumed office, then, [Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed] Morsi was barely more than a figurehead, the public face to a democracy already gutted.

 >Morsi tried mightily to claw back the authority taken from his office. Ignoring the fiat of the Supreme Constitutional Court, he ordered the dissolved Islamist-­dominated Parliament reinstated. Even more boldly, he dismissed the senior military leadership, including the powerful defense minister. In his place, **Morsi promoted his own man, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi**>…

 A few months later:
>It was at this critical juncture that the defense minister, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, until then regarded as a bland functionary, finally stepped from the shadows. On July 1, the general delivered an ultimatum to the man who had appointed him, giving Morsi 48 hours “to meet the demands of the people” or the army would step in to restore order. Pointing out that he was the elected head of state, the president defiantly dismissed the threat.

 And then:
>True to his word, on July 3, Sisi overthrew the Egyptian government. He alo annulled the Constitution, arrested Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and shut down four television stations. Within days, he announced the formation of an interim “transitional” government, one composed of military officers and Mubarak-­era apparatchiks, but all Egyptians knew that the real authority now lay with Sisi.

 I've said before that Game of Thrones seems more realistic when one considers current theaters in the Middle East.

 Indeed, doesn't Morsi’s inaction in the face of clear and present danger to his leadership remind you of Ned Stark? Both Ned and Morsi lacked the healthy mistrust and the knife-sharp elbows they needed to fight off external and internal threats.

 The Lannisters mauled and killed Ned’s men in the street. Still Ned felt confident enough to tell Cersei Lannister he knew that her children were the product of incest. Morsi telegraphed his defiance of the military establishment in such open, gentlemanly fashion that the anti-Muslim-Brotherhood forces (specifically the military) in Egypt knew every card in his hand.

 In the end, Ned's plans to maintain leadership relied on someone who he didn’t like or trust but at least thought was “his own man” – Petyr Baelish – to defend him. Morsi had someone he thought was his own man in Sisi. Sisi wasn’t Muslim Brotherhood – indeed Sisi was from the military establishment – but Morsi trusted him anyway.

 And they both lived happily ever after. Ned got imprisoned and beheaded. Morsi has been imprisoned and sentenced to death.
