The details of Canada’s plan to implement emissions pricing throughout Canada show an interesting nuance to comparisons between carbon taxes and cap and trade. Policymakers often view them as two distinct tools which “put a price on carbon” in different ways.

A carbon tax places forces businesses whose activities cause greenhouse gas emissions (burning fuel, making cement, farming cows) to pay a tax on those emissions — usually a set charge per ton of CO2 equivalent. A cap-and-trade regime forces these businesses to purchase an “allowance” for every ton of CO2e, but the allowance prices can fluctuate upwards or downwards. Many purported differences between the two systems — such as the use of “carbon credits” or the provision of “free allowances” — turn out to be applicable, at least in theory, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~goulder/Papers/Published%20Papers/Goulder%20and%20Schein%20-%20Carbon%20Taxes%20vs%20Cap%20and%20Trade%20-%20Cl%20Ch%20Economics.pdf">to both</a>. The key difference is that cap and trade sets a fixed emissions quantity and lets emissions prices fluctuate, whereas carbon taxes keep a fixed emissions price.

What Canada’s policy demonstrates is that even this key difference — that the price is set under a carbon tax, whereas the quantity is set under cap and trade — turns to be muddier upon application of the policy tools.

The New York Times Editorial Board <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/opinion/canadas-trudeau-steps-up-on-climate-change.html?_r=0">writes</a>:


> Each of Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories [will] choose its own method of carbon pricing, whether a direct tax on emissions or a cap-and-trade system under which governments put a ceiling on emissions and allow utilities, manufacturing plants, fuel distributors and others to buy and sell permits to emit greenhouse gases. Whatever system the provinces and territories choose, they must establish a price by 2018, starting at a minimum of 10 Canadian dollars per ton of carbon (about $7.60 in American dollars) and rising to at least 50 Canadian dollars in 2022.


In this way, even provinces using cap and trade must implement a “price floor.” There are various ways that governments can put a price floor into action, but once the floor is binding and businesses under cap and trade buy allowances at a set minimum price, the system becomes for many intents and purposes perfectly <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~goulder/Papers/Published%20Papers/Goulder%20and%20Schein%20-%20Carbon%20Taxes%20vs%20Cap%20and%20Trade%20-%20Cl%20Ch%20Economics.pdf">analogous to a carbon tax</a>.

### This matters because some of cap and trade’s disadvantages go away when they are designed with price floors

Cap and trade sets a quantity of allowances equal to the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions that the government wants the economy to get to. Put more simply: it sets a limit on greenhouse gases.

What’s less well understood is that a pure cap-and-trade program’s emissions **limit** is also an emissions **minimum**. Once an economy is at the greenhouse gas quantity set by the cap-and-trade regime, any new events that might normally lower the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions will instead reduce the <i>price</i> of <i>allowances</i>. For example, if the government wages a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-war-on-coal-is-worth-fighting">worthy</a> war on coal, this war would reduce the need for allowance purchases from coal power plants (because they would be closing down), which would reduce allowances' price, which would allow <i>other</i> allowance purchasers such as gas power plants and cement companies to buy more allowances. The amazing result is that the war on coal wouldn't change total emissions at all, unless allowance prices went all the way to zero.

With a price floor, there’s a lower limit on how far prices can go down. Once allowance prices get down to the price floor, further efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions <i>will</i> yield results. This is critical because politicians may not be sufficiently worried about climate change at this point in time, so we need tools that allow them to ratchet up their boldness as time goes on.

### Why use cap and trade at all, if doing something that makes it more like a tax is so helpful?

There are nice advantages to cap and trade. For one, it allows policymakers to give away free allowances to businesses. This is a way to help energy-intensive manufacturing companies who might otherwise be hurt by the program. Policymakers <i>can</i> do a similar thing with carbon taxes, but so far in the history of carbon tax implementations, they have rarely used this kind of tool, perhaps because the way it would work is a little more difficult to understand (i.e. beyond the scope of this blog post!).

Cap and trade with a price floor is a nice hybrid program. It has some of the benefits of tax-based systems -- such as the ability to add new programs to fight climate change later -- and some of the benefits of allowance-based systems -- such as the ability to soften the impact of fighting climate change for businesses who would otherwise be bruised by emissions pricing.
