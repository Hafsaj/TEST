In 2015, Greece and the EU played a high-stakes game of chicken to resolve Greece's "debt" crisis. In the end Greece blinked. As you'll see in this post, I think the EU was the villain in that game.

Spain's situation vis-a-vis the EU is similar, but Spain's bargaining position is much stronger. I hope it jabs its finger deep into the EU's eye. Such eye-jabbing would be great for Spain and -- perhaps counter-intuitively -- it would be good for the EU too. It's high time for the EU to embrace the utterly uncontroversial idea of deficit spending to reduce unemployment.

### Greek's debt crisis

The immediate cause of Greece's crisis -- the reason it needed a bailout from the EU -- was that it couldn't pay back the creditors who had lent it money. My idol Matt Yglesias has written a lot about how Greece's crisis in 2015 stemmed from a series of previous bailouts that didn't actually absolve Greece of its debts. Instead, they transferred the debts from private creditors (mostly private banks) to other European governments (and the IMF). As Matt <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/6/30/8868363/greece-crisis-default-austerity" target="_blank">writes</a>:

>Rather than have Greece default, and then possibly need to bail out their own banks, European governments gave Greece giant loans so Greece could pay the banks what they owed.

In return for this, EU governments and the IMF wanted "reforms" from Greece. Part of these reforms were to reduce government borrowing and to have a **surplus**  on the government's yearly spending and revenue. This contravenes basic Econ 101 what-to-do-when-unemployement-is-high, which is that the government should run up a larger-than-usual deficit to compensate for slack demand.

Left-wing economist Paul Krugman wrote a lot about how crazy, cruel, and unusual these demands on Greece were. Krugman controversially <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/opinion/paul-krugman-weimar-on-the-aegean.html" target="_blank">compared</a> these demands to the back-breaking reparations Germany was forced to agree to pay after WW1.  In one memorable back-of-the-envelope analysis, Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/weimar-and-greece-continued/" target="_blank">showed:</a>

>Austerity, it turns out, has devastated Greece just about as much as defeat in total war devastated imperial Germany.<img src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/9OaviIVqRiUPfWM_fJ8Zp8Pwj5w_Sc0MivacQGpiJxR8A3juRec2sU2UPIwTIOL5fEtrFDNvdBDEcB1j5l7U-OCffMlTroRTBbTB_pbWc4lt7Re73rgdLP0vfqzIlzPFljxpgfqh7Q=s0-d-e1-ft#https://foodandpoliticking.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/021515krugman1-blog480.png" width="480" height="269" />

And yet what Greece's new creditors (the EU and IMF) wanted was for Greece to increase its budget surplus even further -- i.e. by raising taxes, cutting public programmes, cutting welfare programmes, cutting public employees' salaries, etc.

Against this backdrop, 2015 elections in Greece brought to power the first totally anti-austerity party in Europe to win enough seats to lead a Parliamentary majority.

### Greek's debt crisis, renegotiated

When this new, left-wing, anti-austerity party, Syriza, won enough seats in Parliament to lead it, 2015's amazing game of chicken between Greece and the EU was on. Syriza had won the most seats in Greece's Parliament on the back of promises to renegotiate the terms of Greece's relationship with its creditors (EU governments and the IMF).

My blog-crush, Matt, writes about Syriza's rise in something of a negative tone that -- very unusually for me -- I think is unreasonable. He writes that Syriza "sold Greek voters on a lie."
>In its successful 2015 electoral campaign, Syriza told the Greek electorate what it wanted to hear: that there was a path out of the nightmare of austerity and external political control into which Greece had fallen that <i>didn’t</i> involve leaving the Eurozone.

As things turned out, the EU held very firm and made sure that Syriza stayed in the nightmare of austerity.

But although Syriza lost the game of chicken, the EU didn't win. By forcing the Greek economy to nosedive even more than it had to, it made the Greek government's debt crisis even worse than it had to be, which is bad for Greece but also bad for Greek's creditors (who, remember, are now European governments and the IMF) and for Europe as a whole.

So I was surprised by the EU's extremely harsh negotiating tactics. There was absolutely room for both sides to get something they wanted. The EU could have gotten Greece to loosen its labour markets (I dunno, reduce intensely strong protections against firing workers, etc.). But Greece could have obtained permission to run a smaller budget surplus (or not have to run a surplus at all, as long as they didn't have to borrow more money either).

The key to understanding how (and why) the EU took such a tough line -- to the point that they cut off their nose to spite their face -- was that Greece was in a uniquely bad bargaining position.

If it were still **private banks**  holding Greek debt, the EU might have worried that a Greek default on that debt would bring down those banks, causing another banking crisis. Instead, the debt had been transferred to government institutions who would be annoyed but not crippled by a Greek default.

Meanwhile, EU elites worried that if they bowed to **any**  Greek demands, it would set the precedent for other indebted countries that had also been lent money (such as Spain) to demand less austerity too.

Put differently: Greece wasn't too big too fail, and so the EU let it keep on failing.

### Spain is too big to fail, and that gives it leverage

Spain is different from Greece in four ways. They all point to Spain having more leverage.

1. Spain did not have much debt until after they had to bail out their own banks after the financial crisis. Their debt (as a % of GDP) was lower than Germany's until the financial crisis struck. If the EU had been one state instead of a confederation of states, these bank bailouts wouldn't even have counted as part of Spain's debt.

2. Spain never got any specific bailouts per se. They did get money for their banks, but this was earmarked for the banks.

3. With (up until now) a Conservative government in power, Spain has participated pretty readily in taking suggestions from the EU (and IMF and US) to slow down its debt buildup. Their deficit went from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to 7.1% in 2013, and they amended their Constitution in 2020 to require a balanced budget by 2020 and mandate that public debt cannot exceed 60% of GDP except during exceptional circumstances.

4. Spain's economy is five times bigger than Greece's. If it defaulted on its debt, the EU (and the world) economy might really melt down.

Spain doesn't have a sovereign debt crisis right now.

But it does have an unemployment crisis. While America's unemployment rate recently dipped below 5%, Germany's has already been below 5%, and the UK is hovering around 5%,  both Greece and Spain's unemployment rates are above 20%. That's in line with unemployment levels in the America DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION.

For this reason, a new leftwing coalition in Spain could -- and should -- actually, it would be cruel dereliction of their voters' and citizens' best interest for it do anything otherwise -- try something different.

### Spain's in such a good negotiating position, it doesn't need to play radical, high-stakes games of chicken

This sounds reckless, but Spain should poke the EU in the eye. It needs to stimulate the economy -- i.e. roll back some of the austerity -- in a pure, basic, totally economically uncontroversial effort to reduce unemployment.

Spain is lucky. Unlike Greece, it has no sovereign debt crisis. It should use its strong position to work on reducing its unemployment rate. It should -- carefully -- **increase**  its deficit, perhaps drawing on funds from the European Central Bank.

This is the spirit of the wave of public support that chopped apart Spain's loosely two-party system. This is what made over <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/12/20/media/1450594744_312762.html" target="_blank">24%</a> of Spain vote for an upstart party, Podemos (and allied groups in Catalunya and Galicia).

Add that total to the vote total for the traditional left-wing party (the Socialists), and, of the voters in Spain who didn't vote for regional parties, a majority voted for one of the two major leftwing parties. As I <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/spanish-politics-its-really-not-that-comlicated/" target="_blank">wrote</a> last in my last post about Spain:

>Spanish voters have spoken and — do the math — they want an anti-austerity coalition. It’s just not that complicated.

I predicted that the Socialists would lead a Parliamentary majority with Podemos' support. Events this week seem to have made that less likely. It seems that the Socialists really want to coalition with <a href="http://elpais.com/m/politica/2016/02/05/actualidad/1454694811_748837.html" target="_blank">both Podemos **and**  Citizens</a>, a centrist anti-separatist party. Podemos has <a href="http://elpais.com/m/politica/2016/02/05/actualidad/1454674257_278549.html" target="_blank">vetoed</a> this idea, and the Socialists haven't looked kindly on that veto.

I still predict that when this all shakes out, Socialists+Podemos lead a Parliamentary majority.

But I admit that I also **want**  that result. I hope Podemos tacks the Socialists to the left, make them fight hard against austerity. Such a fight would be good for Spain, and, although a bit late, it would be good for Europe too. The push for austerity in economically depressed European countries has always been ludicrous and continues to be ludicrous. Europe would be stronger if it relaxed its commitment to ever-harsher deficit-cutting in economically depressed member states.
