Living in England, I've been dimly aware of the recent Labour leadership contest, where a total outsider named Jeremy Corbyn won a stunning upset (betting markets had him at <a href="http://www.cityam.com/223763/labour-leadership-odds-how-have-runners-and-riders-performed-over-time">66:1</a> just a few months ago).

Part-time blogger, full-time superhero Matt Yglesias has an interesting <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/9/12/9314975/jeremy-corbyn-david-cameron">quickie think piece</a> on the landslide upset victory, noting that the Conservatives have owned the center of politics in Britain in a way that is super different from the ever-rightward GOP situation in America. He gives a few hot-button issues where the British Conservatives are in basically the same place, opinion-wise, as Obama Democrats:

*Gays and lesbians should have equal marriage rights.

*Human activity is causing dangerous climate change, and something should be done about this.

*The government should guarantee health insurance to everyone.

*Taxes should not be cut so deeply as to cause a large budget deficit.

Enviro friends of mine would challenge dot #2, but the Conservatives' credentials on climate change are legit. Although they've been insufficiently supportive of subsidies for renewables, the Conservatives are the reason that England is one of the few countries in the world to have something approaching a serious carbon tax.

Matt notes that with the Conservatives owning the center, there's nowhere to go for Labour but left.

Another favorite blogger of mine, Paul Krugman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/opinion/paul-krugman-labours-dead-center.html?_r=0">points out</a> that Corbyn was the only Labour candidate to take mainstream economics seriously. In a time of high unemployment, low inflation, and low government borrowing rates, it doesn't make sense to cut government borrowing. Or, put more simply, even mainstream economists think the British and European austerity craze is totally idiotic.

For me, this is the crux of why, if I had a vote in this new country in which I find myself, I would support Labour. I like to choose issues that are simple, where experts widely agree on what to do, but where for dumb reasons (like, they're bought by special interests, etc.), one party doesn't take the experts' advice. In the US, that's climate change and immigration, where <a href="http://www.carbontax.org/scientists-economists/">climate change experts</a> and <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/09/climate-policy">economists</a> widely agree we should implement a carbon tax and that immigration is a <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/8/17/9164725/immigration-and-wages-impact">net benefit</a> for the economy, yet Republicans are massively on the other sides of both those issues.

In the UK, this way of choosing which party to support is a bit more difficult. Conservatives aren't batshit crazy on climate change. I like some of their ideas. <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/andrew-asks-rachel-who-are-the-philadelphia-76ers-of-the-development-space/">Universal Credit</a> in theory sounds really awesome; after all, people should be able to spend their benefits how they want to, rather than being told what to do with those benefits. But the party's wholesale rejection of Econ 101 on the austerity/stimulus issue makes the choice easier, especially at a time when unemployment is still such a big problem in Europe and even the UK (especially outside of London).
