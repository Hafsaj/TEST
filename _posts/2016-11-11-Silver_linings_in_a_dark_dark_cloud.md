I voted for Hillary and was excited about the vote as an affirmation of what she represented to me: a <a href="http://www.vox.com/a/hillary-clinton-interview/the-gap-listener-leadership-quality">superlative listener and policy thinker</a> who would maintain and reaffirm Obama's policies to fight climate change, improve America's tattered social safety net, keep the economy on a steady course, and steadily move towards embodying the welcoming, open society we purport to represent.

Instead we got Trump, a toxic combination of white nationalism and xenophobic populism. He represents a similar wave coursing through many high-income countries -- UK, Poland, Hungary, perhaps even Germany. Worst of all, Obama's key policy victories are in jeopardy, most scarily his achievements in fighting climate change.

The Republicans now have a lock on all levers of power in the US. The President, the House, the Senate, and (soon, once the Republican Senate approves President Trump's appointee to replace Justice Scalia) a majority on the Supreme Court. Less well-known is that they also run a great <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/10/19/9565119/democrats-in-deep-trouble">majority</a> of the 50 states' governorships and legislatures.

Nor do I buy that we should feel hopeful about Donald Trump's delegation skills or the team he'll bring on (which are key points of a semi-viral but deeply flawed <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/11/its-going-to-be-okay.html">Wait But Why perspective </a>on the election). His team is as scary as he is. A climate-change denying coal industry veteran is apparently the front-runner to head the EPA.

Yet there are silver linings for Democrats (and thus for the world, because Republicans are climate-change deniers, amongst other things). All of these "<a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/09/22/a-hillary-victory-may-open-a-pandoras-box-of-bad-in-2018-and-2020/">consolation</a> <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-party-that-loses-this-year-could-still-win-a-big-consolation-prize/">prizes</a>" are variations on one theme: there are tactical and message-based advantages to being insurgents.

<h3>Democrats can finally ride the thermostat</h3>

It's a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2013/09/30/americans-are-more-conservative-than-they-have-been-in-decades/">truism</a> of political science that American politics is "thermostatic." When Republicans control power, the national mood (or perhaps just the mood of the median swing voter) shifts Democrat. When Democrats control power, the mood shifts against them.

This truism is an oversimplification because both parties can hold "power" at the same time, as was the case for most of President Obama's terms, as he faced off again and again with a hostile Congress controlled by Republicans. It turns out that when government is divided, the thermostat works against the **President's** party. This is why the Republicans rode "anti-establishment" waves in 2010 and 2014 despite running some of Congress and holding majorities on the Supreme Court).

<h3>Democrats can now rebuild from below</h3>

It's hard to make policy when the only lever of power available is the Presidency. It's heartbreaking that Hillary would have been President had the margins in "blue wall" states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan swung <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-a-difference-2-percentage-points-makes/">1 point</a> in her favor. But let's not forget that <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/09/22/a-hillary-victory-may-open-a-pandoras-box-of-bad-in-2018-and-2020/">her Presidency would have been grim</a>. The House and perhaps Senate would have remained arrayed against her, and the midterm anti-President backlash in 2018 would have been a shit-show for Democrats, with steep losses in the Senate and House strengthening Republicans' hand even further.

Instead, 2018's anti-President thermostatic backlash will bolster Democrats. Equally important albeit less sexy is the chance to retake some governorships and statehouses in 2017 and beyond. These races decide which ideas are tried by the America's "laboratories of democracy" (its states). The Republican waves of 2010 and 2014, for example, have set abortion rights back an astonishing amount, as states led by Republicans have experimented with <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/9/8/9273685/abortion-rights-obama-pro-life">restrictions on abortions providers</a> at an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/01/03/states-passed-205-abortion-restrictions-in-three-years-thats-totally-unprecedented/">unprecedented</a> rate.

<h3>Democrats can use 2020 to un-<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/ratfcked-the-influence-of-redistricting">ratfuck</a> themselves</h3>

Karl Rove once brutally gloated that the Democrats chose their wave years badly -- while they won big in 2006 and 2008, the Republican wave in 2010 allowed Republicans to redraw districts to make sure the House would be in Republican hands through 2020. Democrats were "<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/ratfcked-the-influence-of-redistricting">ratfucked</a>" by this aggressive partisan district-drawing. They can (and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-19/republicans-win-congress-as-democrats-get-most-votes">do</a>) win majorities of voters while still obtaining only a minority of Representatives in the House, partly because House districts have been drawn to disadvantage Democrats.

Districts are redrawn by each state legislature every 10 years -- supposedly according to the new Census results, but also of course according to political expediency. 2020 is the next redrawing. This makes 2020 a ridiculously important election, not just for Democrats to retake the Presidency, but also for them to ride an anti-Trump insurgency to a position of strength on the local and state levels. This position of strength, in turn, will allow them to finally make large gains in the House of Representatives.

<h3>Democrats will be on the insurgents' side of the revolution</h3>

Speaking of insurgency, people are <a href="https://theawl.com/i-talked-to-some-trump-voters-too-24d8399a6147">angry</a>. Trump, despite his post-victory tweet that "we will all come together as never before," isn't going to reduce that anger. I predict that he will be the target of that anger, sooner or later.

If the people want a revolution, it's hard to win them over when your party runs the Presidency -- even if your message makes a heap of a lot more sense to folks who feel left behind by globalization. This, in a nutshell, was Hillary's challenge.

Anger is powerful. Certainly, that is the message of this past Tuesday.

There are rabble-rousing messaging benefits to being the angry insurgents. I'm terrified by the next four years but also hopeful that Democrats can use them wisely.
