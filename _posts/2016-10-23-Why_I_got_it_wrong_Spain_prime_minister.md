Almost a year ago, I <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/spains-not-in-crisis/">predicted</a> that the Socialists would lead Spain’s next government. I was so sure of this that I proceeded to write <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/21/its-in-various-spanish-party-leaders-interest-to-pretend-that-spanish-politics-are-in-disarray-even-though-the-path-forward-psoe-podemos-regional-parties-is-so-obvious/">more</a> posts gloating and <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/spanish-politics-its-really-not-that-comlicated/">lauding</a> myself **in advance** for correctly predicting what would happen.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/23/world/europe/ap-eu-spain-politics.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=1&amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;gwh=E50355CA057AF3CA4155F07F4540A09D&amp;gwt=pay">I did not correctly predict what would happen</a>. In the tradition of <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-i-acted-like-a-pundit-and-screwed-up-on-donald-trump/">grand mea culpas for bad predictions</a>, here is a post on why I flubbed this prediction.



### Spain has some peculiar country-specific fault-lines that have divided its left-wing parties. I disregarded them. That was dumb.


While it’s true that no country actually has uni-dimensional politics, most countries have two main movements. From the US to the UK to Australia to Italy to France, and beyond, the party that is socially liberal tends to also support stronger state-based social safety nets. For that matter, this "leftwing" party usually is also more likely to advocate strong environmental protection, is seen as more dovish in foreign policy, is friendlier to irregular or undocumented immigrants, and is more willing to risk inflation for the sake of taming unemployment. Usually the “right-wing” party take the opposite side of these issues. Indeed, you can hear about a “left-wing” or “right-wing” party in a country where you don't know much about the politics and usually correctly predict the party’s positions on these seemingly disconnected issues. Upon reflection, this is weird. But it's true in so many countries that we take it for granted.

This conventional right/left split historically applied to Spain’s politics, too, with the caveat that small regional parties pursued their own regional interests. But in the elections in 2015, the left effectively split in two.

My biased read on this split was that lots of left-wingers were furious at the Socialists for not fighting harder against <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/business/international/europe-economy-budget-austerity.html">idiotic</a> austerity, ditched the Socialists in their fury, and joined the upstart left-wing party Podemos. After all, Podemos got its start in Spain’s magnificent, seemingly spontaneous, nationwide anti-austerity protests. They took that energy and channelled it into an electoral beast.

But Podemos’ leader made a crafty (or perhaps heartfelt) decision to support separatist regions’ right to have referendums on whether to remain part of or break away from Spain. This decision was crucial to Podemos’ electoral success, for example driving their partner party to an astonishing first place in the large and important separatist region of Catalonia. (Side note: Naomi and I visited Catalonia after I wrote the original posts above, and I was stunned by the separatist fervour. Separatist Catalan flags were everywhere, including on town halls and other government buildings.)

The Socialists did not want voters to see them as a separatist-friendly party, so their first coalition-building efforts was with *Citizens*, a new centre-right anti-corruption party whose original raison dêtre was anti-separatism. Citizens and Podemos made clear they couldn’t work together, and to my amazement the Socialists did not do much to try to get Podemos to bend on this, nor did they try to pursue a coalition with **just** Podemos, even though <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/spanish-politics-its-really-not-that-comlicated/">the math would have **just** worked</a>. They didn't want to be tarred with Podemos' separatist-friendly brand, so they wanted the cover having Citizens in the coalition mix, too.

I was equally surprised by Podemos. I had thought that they would sacrifice their referendum piety if they could beat back austerity. As became clear over the proceeding year, Podemos’ leaders (and voters, perhaps) care as much or more about regional autonomy as they do about fighting austerity.

Spain never did form a government. They had more elections which produced broadly similar results. It now looks as though the Socialists will enable the conservative party to form a government.

One might also note that Spain’s lack of government has <a href="http://www.vox.com/world/2016/9/30/13093774/spain-government-politics-economic-growth">**de facto** allowed it to stave off some austerity</a>, which has been a godsend for its economy. In this way, one might argue that Podemos – by blocking the formation of a government – has won a policy battle in the anti-austerity war.

Still, I am disappointed with both leftwing parties. As someone who doesn't have strong opinions about whether Catalonia (and the Basque Country) stay or go, I wished both left-wing parties had buried their differences on that issue for the greater good of fighting austerity. I focused too much on that wish, and it blinded me to the trouble that the separatism issue would create for a stable coalition.

### A lesson for thinking about politics in other countries: beware the emotional identity issue that divides and scuttles broad leftwing movements

Spain is special in terms of the passion that its separatist movements evoke in its citizens. But these sorts of emotional "identity" issues may divide leftwing (and rightwing) movements in countries across the world.

In the UK, Labour is in disarray over how to respond to Brexit and anxieties over immigration, with some leaders arguing for defiance against Brexit while others, noting that many Labour voters **voted for Brexit**, chart a <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/09/after-leadership-battle-immigration-labours-new-dividing-line">tough-on-immigration</a> course for the party. These divisions make difficult a broad alliance between pro-EU leftwing parties, namely the Green Party, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats.

How the left responds to immigration anxiety is a tricky issue in much of Europe as well as other rich countries like the US and Australia. Spain's experience with separatism's divisiveness should makes left-wingers nervous about their tribe's ability to bridge divides on immigration policy when it is a salient issue.

In the US, right now, it is the **right** who has been thrown into disarray by immigration politics, but that may be particular to Trump rather than something to expect about politics for the next 10-20 years.
