title: Why people who correct other people's grammar aren't just wrong but also tapping into (and entrenching) some pretty ugly politics

One of the first things you learn in any introductory linguistics is to wholly reject the false idea that some varieties of speech are “correct” while others are “incorrect.” What you learn is that speaking “ungrammatically” is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticality">by definition</a> <i>not possible</i> for someone who speaks a language as their first language. If they’re using a different sentence construction than you’re used to, that’s just a sign that they’re using a different language variety (with a different grammar) than you’re used to.

This is a big obsession of mine. I hate when people correct other people’s grammar. It’s not just that they’re being snobs — they’re being uneducated snobs. (The worst kind of snob.)

Obviously my other big obsession is reading everything written by Matt Yglesias.

Today my world SHOOK as my two obsessions collided when Matt Yglesias <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/1/29/10869298/weeds-taxes-third-parties">started talking</a> (go to minute 1:14:00 for the audio) about the falseness of the correct/incorrect language variety distinction. Specifically, he showed some heart-breaking negative effects of this incorrect idea -- and uplifting positive effects of rejecting it. (Emphasis added.)

>There was research done in the 1980s, and it showed that -- as I think people know intuitively -- the vernacular English that African Americans tend to use, particularly working class African Americans, is different from the standard American English, and that they started labelling this African American vernacular English, and there were studies showing that if in an educational context kids, **if instead of constantly scolding black kids for talking in the way that is typical of working-class African Americans in the United States, you actually gave them written material in which people spoke in African American vernacular English, that they found this reading much more engaging** and they learned the stuff about reading that's important, which is not how do you conjugate the verb "to be" in different contexts, but it's like "what do letters mean and how do they relate to sounds and how do you do decode whole sentences and paragraphs." And there were big educational gains from this.

Matt goes on to talk about the majority-black Oakland school district which tried to implement this research. They got nationally panned for their efforts. As Matt facetiously notes:

>**Everyone knows the whole point of school is to teach you to talk like white people.**

I'm not sure how much I can add, except that next time someone corrects another first-language speaker's grammar and labels it ungrammatical, we should recognize that not only are they 1) snobby and 2) misunderstanding the very basics of linguistics, but also 3) furthering and entrenching the subjugation of other groups by incorrectly and immorally making them feel inferior.
