title: It's the first time my vote for a candidate for President has ever mattered, so I'm voting for...John Kasich

California primaries are usually too late in the primary election cycle for their result to matter. And California has (in my lifetime) been too blue for its result to matter in the general election for President. This year, however, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-state-by-state-roadmap-for-the-rest-of-the-republican-primary/">California's primary may be decisive</a>.

Although I identify as a pretty hardcore liberal, I've registered as a Republican because it is the primary whose result matters more to me. Whereas I like both Hillary and Bernie, it is the Republican primary that features a dramatic, stark choice between styles, ideologies, and personality types.

I try to keep politics simple. I want to fight climate change. I like <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/9/13/6135905/open-borders-bryan-caplan-interview-gdp-double">open borders</a>. I like <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/5/5783086/more-evidence-that-giving-poor-people-money-is-a-great-cure-for">giving money</a> and economic resources to people who need them most. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are my worst nightmare on all three of those issues. So my choice is easy -- Kasich the "moderate". (The craziness of the idea that Kasich is a moderate probably requires a separate blog post.)

The one complication is tactical. I prefer Hillary (or Bernie, pending some political miracle for him) to any of the three remaining Republicans. Would it be better to vote for the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-really-unpopular-with-general-election-voters/">weaker general election candidate in Trump</a>? Or perhaps vote for Cruz, in order to precipitate a <a href="http://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/4/5/11370102/republicans-lose-2016">contested convention that sinks the Republican party this cycle</a>?

I ran this question by my friend Adam. His answer: Always vote for your favourite candidate. Even if Kasich has no chance to be the nominee, media coverage of the California election will be extremely significant. We need to show Republican politicians and potential politicians that "moderates" like Kasich get votes.

Moreover, Kasich does have a chance. This election cycle has been crazy and a contested convention could result in a Kasich nomination. Still, that chance brings me back to the tactical question -- wouldn't I prefer a weaker general election candidate than Kasich?

It's true that my ranked hierarchy of candidates puts Hillary/Bernie above Kasich, who I place above Trump, who I place above Cruz. But as a risk-averse voter, the sadness and horror I would feel at Kasich winning instead of Hillary is smaller than the sadness and horror I would feel at Trump (or, worse, Cruz) winning instead of Kasich.
