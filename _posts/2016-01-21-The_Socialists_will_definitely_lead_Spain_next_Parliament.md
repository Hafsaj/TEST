I've decided I'm going to spend the next few weeks bragging about how I was right about Spain. Unfortunately I can't find any betting odds about this. Anyway, it's not like I have money to bet anyway. I'll bet my reputation, instead.

My prediction: **Someone from PSOE will be the next Prime Minister of Spain.**

I'm not sure it will be their current leader, Pedro Sanchez. He doesn't have a lock on his own party, and his party did do "badly" in terms of getting fewer seats than they'd ever obtained, so maybe he'll be punished for that. But before this thing shakes out, PSOE has the prime ministership. AND THUS IT IS PREDICTED.

New evidence comes from a little party called Compromís. Compromís is **basically** Podemos of the region of Valencia. But apparently they're <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/01/20/actualidad/1453293140_000608.html">ready</a> to distance themselves from Podemos in order have a "government of change" (and, oh, ahem, they also want better financing for Valencia... as all regional parties must).

En Marea, which is, similarly, **basically** Podemos of the region of Galicia, <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/01/20/actualidad/1453293140_000608.html">say</a> they'll only support Pedro Sanchez if PSOE support a leftwing overhaul (proyecto de izquierdas) in Spain -- which I read as basic anti-austerity.

Meanwhile, an old-school regional party in the Basque country is ready to support PSOE as long as they make some concessions to Basque self-determination.

Spain's two-party + regional parties system has always been a bit disastrous for Spanish national unity, because it gives the regional parties leverage whenever neither of the two main parties has a majority (which was often). Now it's the same situation, except that we should think of PSOE and Podemos as obvious coalition partners-to-be, thus occupying the national left-wing space previously solely owned by PSOE. The only questions now are how anti-austerity PSOE will let itself be, and what concessions the regional parties can extract. Sanchez <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2016/01/07/actualidad/1452182747_174192.html">seems ready to be pretty anti-austerity</a>. But is he and his party ready to let regions vote on whether to stay in Spain?

I do think PSOE has a strong hand here. PP has no route to majority except through PSOE. They may have the most seats, but they're not going to lead the Parliament. On the other hand, PSOE has only **one** route to majority, and it goes through regional parties (and Podemos). Expect some painful concessions of the national unity question.

The fact that there is only one route to a stable government -- but that this route is going to be painful -- probably explains why everyone is acting like Spain is in disarray, <a href="https://foodandpoliticking.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/spains-not-in-crisis/">even though it isn't</a>. As long as PSOE can pretend it won't offer the world to get the prime ministership, it has a stronger hand. Equally, as long as regional parties and Podemos can pretend they may not support PSOE, they have the stronger hand.
